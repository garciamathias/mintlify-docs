## How Credits Work

Presti.ai uses a credit-based system that gives you complete control over your spending. The key principle: **iterate freely, pay only for value**.

<Info>
  **Key Point**: You can generate and regenerate scenes unlimited times. Credits are only deducted when you download the final image.

## Credit Costs by Resolution

Each download resolution requires a different number of credits based on the computational resources needed:
