  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product">
    Upload a photo of your product - anything from a smartphone picture to a professional packshot works. The better the quality, the better your results.
    
    <Info>
      We'll automatically remove the background if needed, keeping only your product to then create the perfect ambiance around it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Accessorize Your Product">
    Add accessories around your product to enhance your composition. These will become part of your packshot once you click "Save changes."

    **How to add accessories:**
    - Use the brush tool to define where you want the accessory - the brush size tells the AI how big to make the item
    - Make the brushing slightly larger than the desired item size
    - Be specific in your descriptions for better results:
      - Instead of: "Brown dog"
      - Try: "Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in a blue wool blanket"
    
    <Tip>
      Build up accessories gradually - add one, save your image, then add another. This gives you more control over the final composition.
    </Tip>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position Your Product">
    Position and scale your product on the canvas. This placement tells the AI where the floor is and determines your final composition.

      alt="Canvas positioning interface"
    />
    
    **Key positioning tips:**
    - Place your product to show the AI where the "floor" level should be
    - Scale appropriately, leaving room around your product for the scene
    - This position becomes permanent once you generate the background
    
    <Warning>
      If your product fills the entire canvas, you won't be able to zoom out later to add room accessories. Always leave space around your product.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Scene">
    Describe where you want your product placed in the room. Be explicit for better results - for example: "sofa against a wall in a spacious living room".

    />
    
    **Don't worry about details** - our Assisted Prompt tool automatically expands even basic prompts into 30+ detailed keywords, optimizing your results. Just describe the general vibe you want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate & Refine">

    **Refine until perfect:**
    - Generate as many times as you want - no limits
    - Adjust your prompt to fine-tune results
    - Pick your favorite and use editing tools to perfect it
