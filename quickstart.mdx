## Getting Started with Presti.ai

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Product">
    Upload a high-quality product photo. Both silo shots (white background) and lifestyle shots work - we'll automatically remove the background.
    
    <Info>
      **Pro tip**: Use the highest resolution available for best results.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position Your Product">
    Place and scale your product on the canvas. This position is **permanent** - it tells the AI where the floor is and how to build the scene.
    
    <Warning>
      Leave empty space around your product for the AI to generate the scene. If the product fills the whole canvas, you won't be able to accessorize later.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Scene">
    Use the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired scene. The AI will expand your idea into 30+ detailed keywords automatically.
    
    Example: "Modern living room with natural light"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate & Refine">
    Click "Generate background" and watch the magic happen! You can:
    - Regenerate unlimited times
    - Edit the prompt for adjustments
    - Use editing tools to perfect the scene
