## Generation Issues

### Product Positioning Problems

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Floating Product">
    **Problem**: Product appears to float above floor
    
    **Causes**:
    - Placed too high on canvas
    - Canvas doesn't understand floor level
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Reload image in editor
    2. Move product lower on canvas
    3. Scale appropriately
    4. Regenerate scene
    
    **Prevention**: Always position bottom of product where floor should be
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cut-off Product">
    **Problem**: Product partially outside frame
    
    **Causes**:
    - Product too large for canvas
    - Positioned at edge
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Scale product smaller
    2. Center on canvas
    3. Leave margin around edges
    
    **Prevention**: Keep product within center 80% of canvas
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Wrong Perspective">
    **Problem**: Product angle doesn't match scene
    
    **Causes**:
    - Original photo angle incompatible
    - AI can't rotate products
    
    **Solution**:
    - Re-photograph from better angle
    - Use different source image
    
    **Prevention**: Shoot at 45Â° angle for versatility
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Unwanted Elements

<Warning>
  **Common Issue**: Extra legs or parts appearing under products (especially corner pieces)
</Warning>

## Multi-Product Issues

### Perspective Mismatch

The #1 issue with multi-product scenes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Diagnose">
    Check if all products photographed from same angle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document">
    Note which products don't match
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-shoot">
    Photograph mismatched items from correct angle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Try with 2 products first
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale Production">
    Once working, add more products
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Scale Relationships

| Problem | Visual Cue | Solution |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Chair too large** | Doesn't fit under table | Scale down 10-20% |
| **Coffee table too high** | Above sofa seat | Lower or scale down |
| **Lamp too small** | Looks like toy | Scale up significantly |
| **Rug too small** | Furniture not on it | Scale up to fit |
