## Quick Fix Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|

## Generation Issues

### Product Positioning
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Floating Product">
    **Fix**: Move product lower on canvas to establish floor contact
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cut-off Product">
    **Fix**: Scale down and center with margins
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Wrong Placement">
    **Fix**: Product position on canvas = final position in scene
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Unwanted Elements
**Problem**: AI adds items not in your prompt  
**Solution**: Use negative prompting - explicitly state what NOT to include

## Scene Quality

### Lighting Problems
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mismatched shadows">
    Use Relight tool: None → Low → Medium → High
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Too dark/bright">
    Adjust Enhance level or edit prompt lighting description
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong time of day">
    Specify in prompt: "morning light", "sunset", "evening"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Background Issues
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blurry">
    Increase Enhance level or use higher resolution source
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unrealistic">
    Simplify prompt - too many details confuse AI
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Style mismatch">
    Use consistent style keywords throughout prompt
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-Product Issues

### Perspective Mismatch
**Critical**: All products MUST be photographed from the same angle

**Fix if mismatched**:
1. Re-photograph products from matching angle
2. Use only products with same perspective
3. Cannot fix in post - AI cannot rotate products

### Scale Problems
| Check | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Size relationships wrong** | Research actual dimensions |
| **Products too large/small** | Manually scale on canvas |
| **Unrealistic proportions** | Use real-world references |

## Performance Issues

### Slow Generation
- Use 2K resolution instead of 4K
- Simplify complex prompts
- Generate during off-peak hours
- Check internet connection

### Quality Degradation
- Upload highest resolution originals
- Avoid over-compressed JPEGs
- Use PNG for transparency
- Don't upscale low-res images
