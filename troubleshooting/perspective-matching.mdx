## The Perspective Challenge

Mismatched perspectives are the #1 cause of unrealistic multi-product scenes. Master this to create professional results.

<Warning>
  **Critical Fact**: Presti.ai cannot rotate products in 3D space. All items must be photographed from the same angle.
</Warning>

## Understanding Perspective

### Why It Matters

When perspectives don't align:
- Objects appear disconnected
- Scene looks amateur
- Depth perception fails
- Customer trust erodes

### Visual Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Avoid: Mismatched">
    **What happens:**
    - Sofa shot from front
    - Chair shot from side
    - Table shot from above
    
    **Result**: Impossible scene geometry
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Good: Matched">
    **What works:**
    - All items at 45° angle
    - Same camera height
    - Consistent distance
    
    **Result**: Natural, cohesive scene
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up Consistent Photography

### Camera Position Standards

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Angle">
    **Recommended**: 45° front-left
    - Shows dimension
    - Works for most furniture
    - Natural viewing angle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark Camera Location">
    - Use tape on floor
    - Mark tripod position
    - Note exact distance
    - Document height
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Reference Guide">
    ```
    Standard Setup:
    - Angle: 45° from front-left
    - Height: 48" (eye level seated)
    - Distance: 10 feet
    - Lens: 50mm equivalent
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Validate">
    - Shoot test product
    - Check angle consistency
    - Adjust if needed
    - Lock in settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

    - Good for sets
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3/4 View">
    **Best for**: Detail showcase
    
    **Setup**:
    - More angle than 45°
    - Emphasizes depth
    - Shows three surfaces
    
    **Advantages**:
    - Dynamic look
    - Maximum visibility
    - Professional feel
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Matching Existing Photography

### When You Can't Re-Shoot

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Analyze existing angle">
    1. Identify vanishing points
    2. Note visible surfaces
    3. Estimate camera position
    4. Document findings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match new shots">
    1. Set up similar angle
    2. Use existing as reference
    3. Compare test shots
    4. Adjust until matched
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group by angle">
    1. Sort products by perspective
    2. Create separate scenes
    3. Don't mix angles
    4. Plan accordingly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Perspective Matching Workflow

### Pre-Production

1. **Audit existing photos**
   - Group by angle
   - Identify mismatches
   - Plan re-shoots

2. **Standardize approach**
   - Choose master angle
   - Document setup
   - Train team

3. **Create templates**
   - Visual guides
   - Setup checklist
   - Angle references

### Production

<Warning>
  Always verify angle match before moving to next product.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up first product">
    Use your documented standard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture reference">
    This becomes your match target
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain consistency">
    Don't move camera between products
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify each shot">
    Compare to reference immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Mismatches

### Diagnostic Tools

| Check | How to Test | What to Look For |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Horizon line** | Draw across image | Should align across products |
| **Vanishing points** | Trace edge lines | Should converge similarly |
| **Surface visibility** | Compare sides shown | Same surfaces visible |
| **Vertical alignment** | Check uprights | Parallel verticals |

### Common Mistakes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Height Variations">
    **Problem**: Camera height changes
    **Result**: Looking up/down mismatch
    **Fix**: Use marked tripod height
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Distance Changes">
    **Problem**: Moving closer/farther
    **Result**: Perspective distortion
    **Fix**: Mark floor position
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Angle Drift">
    **Problem**: Slight rotation between shots
    **Result**: Different face visibility
    **Fix**: Use angle finder
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Angle Templates

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Physical Template" icon="ruler">
    - Floor markings
    - Angle guides
    - Distance markers
    - Height indicators
  </Card>
  <Card title="Digital Reference" icon="image">
    - Overlay guides
    - Grid system
    - Comparison tool
    - Angle analyzer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Batch Photography

For efficiency with multiple products:

1. **Group by size**: Minimize setup changes
2. **Assembly line**: Move products, not camera
3. **Consistent lighting**: Don't adjust between shots
4. **Immediate review**: Catch issues early

## Best Practices

### Documentation

Create a photography guide including:
- Setup diagrams
- Angle specifications
- Distance measurements
- Example images
- Common mistakes

### Team Training

Ensure everyone understands:
- Why perspective matters
- How to check alignment
- Standard procedures
- Quality requirements

### Quality Control

<Steps>
  <Step title="Immediate review">
    Check each shot before moving product
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comparison check">
    Overlay with reference image
  </Step>
  <Step title="Batch validation">
    Review all products together
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final approval">
    Test in multi-product scene
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recovery Options

### When Re-Shooting Isn't Possible

1. **Group by existing angles**: Create separate scenes for each angle group
2. **Single-product focus**: Use individual hero shots instead
3. **Strategic cropping**: Show products partially if needed
4. **Alternative layouts**: Design around the limitation

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: It's always faster to re-shoot than to try fixing perspective mismatches in post.
