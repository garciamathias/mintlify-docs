## Our Story

Presti was founded in 2022 by four friends and engineers who went to university together. With past experiences in building technology and AI, we noticed that the furniture industry, with its logistical complexity, was especially prone to benefit from AI. That's why we decided to build a company to address the need of creating furniture imagery orders of magnitude cheaper and more efficient than the status quo of photography and 3D rendering software and services.

## Today

Today, Presti is incorporated in the US with offices in Paris and more than 300 clients worldwide. We are lucky to be able to work with awesome investors like Partech and Y Combinator, the latter having funded companies like Airbnb, Doordash, or Dropbox.

## Our Mission

We're on a mission to democratize access to high-quality product visuals, enabling furniture businesses of all sizes to compete in the digital marketplace. By combining cutting-edge AI with deep industry understanding, we're making professional product photography accessible to everyone.
