## Best Practices for Batch Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use consistent product images">
    For best results, upload products photographed from similar angles with consistent lighting. This helps the AI maintain coherent styling across all generations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Write clear, descriptive prompts">
    Be specific about the scene you want: "Modern minimalist living room with large windows and natural light" works better than just "living room".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start with a small test batch">
    Try 5-10 products first to ensure your prompt creates the desired aesthetic before processing your entire catalog.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group similar products">
    Process products by category (sofas, chairs, tables) for more cohesive results within each product type.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Processing Speed

<Info>
  Batch processing is optimized for speed - generate dozens of styled images in the time it would take to create just a few manually. Processing time varies based on the number of products and selected resolution.
</Info>

## Credits & Pricing

<Warning>
  Batch mode uses standard credit pricing:
  - Generate unlimited previews for free
  - Credits only used when downloading final images
  - Same credit rates as single generations (1K = 1 credit, 2K = 2 credits, etc.)
</Warning>
