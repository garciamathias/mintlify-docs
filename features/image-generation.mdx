## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Product">
    Start with any product photo - silo shot or existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes backgrounds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position & Scale">
    Position and scale your product on the canvas. This placement tells the AI where the floor is and determines your final composition. Leave space around your product for the scene.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Scene">
    Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    AI creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, maintaining proper lighting, shadows, and perspective.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompting System

### Text Prompt
Write natural language descriptions of your desired scene:
- "Modern minimalist living room with large windows"
- "Cozy bedroom with warm lighting and plants"
- "Scandinavian office space with natural wood"

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does my product appear floating?">
    This happens when the AI can't determine where the floor should be. To fix this:
    - Drag your product lower on the canvas - the bottom edge should touch where you want the floor
    - Leave more space above the product for the AI to generate the room
    - If your product is a wall-mounted item, position it higher and mention "wall-mounted" in your prompt
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are the scale relationships wrong?">
    The AI determines scale based on your product's size on the canvas. To correct this:
    - Use the corner handles to resize your product before generating
    - A sofa should take up 20-30% of the canvas for a realistic room
    - Small items like lamps should be sized down to 5-10% of the canvas
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is the style inconsistent?">
    Style variations happen when prompts are too vague. For consistent results:
    - Upload an inspiration image to lock in a specific aesthetic
    - Use detailed style keywords: "mid-century modern" instead of just "modern"
    - Include specific materials and colors: "white oak floors, cream walls, brass fixtures"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are my scenes over-cluttered?">
    The AI tends to fill empty spaces. To create cleaner scenes:
    - Add style modifiers: "minimalist", "clean", "uncluttered", or "sparse"
    - Specify exact items: "only a coffee table and one plant" instead of "living room furniture"
    - Use negative prompts: mention what you DON'T want in the scene
    - Position your product to take up more canvas space, leaving less room for extra items
