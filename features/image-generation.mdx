## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Product">
    Start with any product photo - silo shot or existing lifestyle image. Our AI automatically removes backgrounds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position & Scale">
    Place your product on the canvas. This position is permanent and tells the AI where the floor is.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Scene">
    Use text prompts or the Assisted Prompt tool to describe your desired environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    AI creates a photorealistic scene in seconds, maintaining proper lighting, shadows, and perspective.
  </Step>
</Steps>
