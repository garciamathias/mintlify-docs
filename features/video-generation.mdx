  <Step title="Select Video Option">
    Click the video icon in the toolbar and add a motion prompt describing what should move in the scene. For example: "golden retriever walks across the room from left to right" or "cat jumps onto the sofa and curls up" or "person enters the room and sits on the chair"

## Best Practices

### Source Image Preparation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with high-quality images">
    Videos inherit the quality of source images.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan your motion prompts carefully">
    Be specific about movement direction and action. "Dog walks from left to right" works better than just "dog moves". The AI needs clear instructions to generate realistic motion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimize lighting before video generation">
    Well-lit scenes produce more dynamic videos with better contrast. If your scene looks too dark or flat, use the Relight tool before converting to video.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choose the right duration">
    5-second videos work well for quick product reveals and social media. 10-second videos are better for storytelling and showing complete actions like someone sitting down or a pet crossing the room.
