## Magic Tools

### Magic Erase

Remove unwanted elements seamlessly from your scene.

**How it works:**
1. Select the Magic Erase tool
2. Paint over objects to remove
3. AI fills the area naturally
4. Maintains scene consistency

**Perfect for:**
- Removing clutter and distractions
- Cleaning up backgrounds
- Simplifying compositions
- Post-generation cleanup

<Tip>
  Paint slightly beyond object edges for best results. Work on one object at a time for cleaner removal.
</Tip>

### Magic Replace

Transform elements while preserving scene composition.

**How it works:**
1. Click on the object you want to change
2. Type what should appear instead (e.g., "metal legs" to replace "wooden legs")
3. AI seamlessly swaps the element while maintaining lighting and perspective

**Common replacements:**
- Material changes (wood to metal, fabric to leather)
- Color variations (beige to gray, oak to walnut)
- Style updates (modern to vintage, simple to ornate)

<Tip>
  Be specific with your replacement description for best results. The AI preserves the original shape and context.

## Adjustment Tools

### Resize Product

Adjust product scale and positioning after generation.

**How it works:**
1. Open the edit panel
2. Select "Resize Product"
3. Adjust the bounding box to reposition or rescale
4. Validate to regenerate the scene

**Perfect for:**
- Fixing unwanted elements like extra furniture legs
- Adjusting product prominence in the scene
- Correcting scale relationships
- Fine-tuning composition

<Warning>
  This tool is especially useful for fixing unwanted elements like extra legs appearing under furniture corners.
</Warning>

### Change Aspect Ratio

Switch between different canvas formats without regenerating.

**Available formats:**
- **Square (1:1)** - Instagram posts, thumbnails
- **Portrait (2:3)** - Pinterest standard, vertical displays
- **Portrait (3:4)** - Instagram portrait, mobile screens
- **Portrait (4:5)** - Instagram vertical, social media
- **Portrait (9:16)** - Instagram Stories, TikTok, Reels
- **Landscape (3:2)** - Standard photography, prints
- **Landscape (4:3)** - Traditional screens, presentations
- **Landscape (5:4)** - Medium format, classic monitors
- **Landscape (16:9)** - Widescreen, YouTube, modern displays

**How it works:**
AI intelligently extends or crops the scene to fit the new ratio while preserving your product placement.

<Note>
  The AI analyzes your scene and fills new areas naturally, maintaining consistent lighting and style.

### Relight

Fine-tune lighting after generation for perfect ambiance.

**Lighting options:**
- **Low** - Dim, moody lighting for evening scenes and cozy atmospheres
- **Medium** - Balanced daylight with natural shadows, most versatile option
- **High** - Bright, airy feel with minimal shadows, perfect for product showcase

**How it works:**
Each setting generates 4 variations. Choose the perfect match or generate more options until you find the ideal lighting.

<Tip>
  Medium lighting works best for most e-commerce needs, while Low creates lifestyle ambiance and High emphasizes product details.

## Enhancement Tools

### Accessorize

Add decorative elements to enhance your scene.

**How it works:**
1. **Before generating background** - this is crucial
2. Select Accessorize tool
3. Brush where accessories should appear
4. Describe each accessory precisely
5. Generate scene with accessories included

**Effective descriptions:**
- ✅ "Potted monstera plant in white ceramic planter"
- ✅ "Stack of hardcover books with neutral spines"
- ✅ "Geometric gold table lamp with white shade"
- ❌ "Plant" (too vague)
- ❌ "Books" (lacks detail)

<Tip>
  Brush size hints at accessory scale. Make brushed area slightly larger than intended and be specific in descriptions for best results.
</Tip>

### Replace Product

Swap your main product while keeping the generated scene.

**How it works:**
1. Select Replace Product tool
2. Upload new product image
3. AI maintains the scene while swapping products
4. Lighting and shadows automatically adjust

**Perfect for:**
- Testing different products in same setting
- Creating product family shots
- A/B testing variations
- Maintaining scene consistency across catalog

<Info>
  The scene lighting, shadows, and composition automatically adjust to match your new product's shape and materials.
