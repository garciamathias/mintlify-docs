## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does my product appear to be floating?">
    This happens when the product is placed too high on the canvas:
    1. Reload the image in editor

    3. The bottom of your product should be where the floor is
    4. Regenerate the scene
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I fix perspective issues in multi-product scenes?">
    **Critical**: All products must be photographed from the same angle

    Common with corner pieces. Fix using Resize Product:
