## Prompt Structure Best Practices

### Essential Components

A great prompt includes:

1. **Room Type & Style**
   - "Transitional-style living room"
   - "Modern minimalist bedroom"
   - "Traditional home office"

2. **Product Placement**
   - "Sofa against the back wall"
   - "Dining table centered in room"
   - "Desk by the window"

3. **Lighting & Atmosphere**
   - "Soft morning light"
   - "Dramatic sunset lighting"
   - "Bright and airy feeling"

4. **Key Elements**
   - Specific furniture pieces
   - Architectural features
   - Decorative elements

### Prompt Formula

```
[Style] [Room Type] with [Product Placement], 
[Lighting Description], [Atmosphere], 
[Key Elements], [Additional Details]
```

**Example**:
"Modern farmhouse living room with gray sofa against shiplap wall, 
warm afternoon light streaming through windows, cozy and inviting atmosphere, 
wooden coffee table, woven rug, potted plants"

## Specificity Guidelines

### Good: Be Specific About:

| Element | Weak | Strong |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Style** | "nice room" | "mid-century modern living room" |
| **Placement** | "sofa in room" | "sofa against north wall facing fireplace" |
| **Lighting** | "good lighting" | "soft natural light from large windows" |
| **Mood** | "comfortable" | "warm, inviting with hygge elements" |

### Avoid: Avoid Over-Specifying:

- Exact measurements
- Technical camera settings  
- Overly complex compositions
- Contradictory elements
