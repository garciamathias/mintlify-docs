## Silo Quality Requirements

Perfect product shots are the foundation of stunning AI-generated scenes. Follow these guidelines for optimal results.

<Info>
  **Key Principle**: The quality of your input directly affects your output. Invest in good product photography.
</Info>

## File Requirements

### Accepted Formats
- **Standard**: .jpg, .png, .webp
- **All common image types** are supported
- **Transparency**: PNG with alpha channel works perfectly
- **File size**: Up to 50MB per image

### Resolution Guidelines

<Warning>
  **Always provide the highest-resolution photos available.** AI can't add detail that isn't there.
</Warning>

| Minimum | Recommended | Optimal |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1000×1000px | 2000×2000px | 4000×4000px+ |
| Web-only use | Standard quality | Print & zoom |

## Background Options

### White Background (Silo)
Traditional product photography with pure white background:
- **Advantages**: Clean, consistent, professional
- **Best for**: E-commerce, catalogs, batch processing
- **Tips**: Ensure true white (#FFFFFF), not gray

### Lifestyle Shots
Existing room scenes with your product:
- **Advantages**: Can extract product with context
- **Process**: AI automatically removes background
- **Use when**: Silo shots unavailable

<Note>
  Background removal is automatic for both types - no manual masking needed!
</Note>

## 3D Rendering Guidelines

### Export Settings
When using 3D software, optimize your exports:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Resolution">
    - **Minimum**: 2K (2048×2048)
    - **Recommended**: 4K (4096×4096)
    - **Maximum quality**: 8K if available
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Textures">
    - Enable all texture maps
    - Maximum texture resolution
    - Include bump/normal maps
    - Proper UV mapping
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Lighting">
    - Neutral studio lighting
    - Soft shadows enabled
    - No harsh directional light
    - Even illumination
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Critical Canvas Placement Rules

### The Permanent Position Principle

<Warning>
  **CRITICAL**: Where you place the product on canvas is its FINAL position. This cannot be changed after generation.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Product">
    Import your silo or lifestyle shot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Position Carefully">
    Place product where it should appear in final scene
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale Appropriately">
    Size tells AI about floor level and perspective
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leave Space">
    Empty canvas space = room for AI to build scene
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Positioning Mistakes

| Mistake | Result | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Product fills canvas** | No room for scene | Scale down, reposition |
| **Floating placement** | Unrealistic scenes | Lower to establish floor |
| **Edge placement** | Cropped results | Center with margin |
| **Wrong scale** | Proportion issues | Reference real-world size |

## Pre-Generation Workflow

### Accessorizing Before Generation

<Info>
  **Rule**: Add ALL accessories BEFORE clicking "Generate background"
</Info>

1. **Position main product** on canvas
2. **Select Accessorize tool**
3. **Brush areas** for each accessory
4. **Describe specifically** what should appear
5. **Then generate** complete scene

### Brush Tool Technique

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Size Guidance" icon="brush">
    - Brush size hints accessory scale
    - Make slightly larger than intended
    - Overlap is better than gaps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Description Quality" icon="pencil">
    - Be specific and detailed
    - Include materials and colors
    - Describe positioning
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Accessory Description Examples

Good: **Good Descriptions:**
- "Sleeping brown Welsh Corgi wrapped in blue wool blanket"
- "Large fiddle leaf fig in white ceramic planter with drainage tray"
- "Stack of 5 hardcover books with neutral linen spines"

Avoid: **Poor Descriptions:**
- "Brown dog"
- "Plant"
- "Books"

## Photography Best Practices

### Lighting Setup
- **Even lighting**: Minimize harsh shadows
- **Neutral color**: Avoid color casts
- **Multiple angles**: Helps AI understand form
- **Consistent exposure**: Across all shots

### Product Preparation
- **Clean thoroughly**: Dust and marks show
- **Steam/iron fabrics**: Remove wrinkles
- **Check alignment**: Straight lines, symmetry
- **Stage properly**: Natural product position

### Technical Tips

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Post-processing">
    - Minimal editing only
    - Maintain natural colors
    - Don't over-sharpen
    - Keep shadows/highlights
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File handling">
